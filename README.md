# Braintumor classification
This study investigated the use of CNN's and transfer learning architectures on multilabel brain tumor classification.
This project is done as an assignment for the Deep Learning course in the fall of 2024 given by Dr. Saygili at Tilburg University.

To replicate our results, clone the entire repository and run the main_notebook.py which imports the necessary libraries and custom functions. 

The hyperparameter_tuning_transfer_leaning notebook depicts the workflow we used to hyperparameter tune our models.
